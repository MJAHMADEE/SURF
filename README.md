## Installation 📥

To get started, you'll need to install the necessary packages and clone the required repositories.

1. Install necessary packages:
   - `cmake`
   - `libopencv-dev`

2. Clone the OpenCV repository and its extra modules from GitHub.

3. Create a build directory and configure OpenCV with CMake, enabling non-free modules.

4. Build and install OpenCV.

## Usage 🚀

Here's a step-by-step guide to use the provided script:

1. **Import necessary libraries**: Ensure you have the following libraries imported:
   - `cv2`
   - `matplotlib.pyplot`
   - `numpy`
   - `os`

2. **Load and process images**: Write a function to check if the image is loaded correctly, and then load and process the images for keypoint detection.

3. **Detect keypoints using SURF and match features**: Use the SURF algorithm to detect keypoints and compute descriptors for the images.

4. **Draw keypoints and match them**: Utilize the Brute Force Matcher to find the best matches between the images and apply ratio tests to filter good matches.

5. **Warp images and display the stitched image**: Define a function to warp the images based on homography and display the final stitched image.
